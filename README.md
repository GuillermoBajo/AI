# Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the work done on various exercises related to artificial intelligence. The main topics covered include the implementation of search algorithms, probabilistic inference, and optimization to solve classic problems such as the 8-puzzle, the missionaries and cannibals problem, the wolf, goat, and cabbage problem, as well as the 8-queens problem.

## Repository Contents

1. **8-puzzle**: Solving the 8-puzzle problem using blind search and informed search algorithms. Techniques like BFS, DFS, and A\* with heuristics such as misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance are applied.

2. **Missionaries and Cannibals / Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage**: Application of different search algorithms to solve these classic logic and planning problems. The results obtained with various algorithms, including BFS, DFS, and informed searches, are evaluated.

3. **8-queens**: Solving the 8-queens problem using local search algorithms like Hill-Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms. Solutions are implemented and evaluated.

4. **Probabilistic Inference in Bayesian Networks**: Implementation of probabilistic inference algorithms in Python using the Ghost-hunter PACMAN game environment. The goal is to track invisible ghosts in a simulated video game environment using Bayesian network inference techniques.

## Requirements

- **Java**: The project uses Java to implement the search and optimization algorithms. Make sure to have JDK version 1.8 installed.
- **Libraries**: The libraries from the `aima.core` and `aima.gui` packages of the AIMA Java library are used.
- **Python**: Exercise 4 requires Python. It is recommended to use a local Python environment with ANACONDA, which includes pre-installed libraries and makes running the programs easier.
